  # Recall that during the full release, the `main` branch's CHANGELOG.rst has been updated, and we want the
  # tag to reflect the latest changes in the CHANGELOG.rst done by the update-changelog above.
  # For more discussions, please read https://github.com/scikit-package/release-scripts/pull/120
  # Always run this job for a full release but fail if the update-changelog job previously failed.
